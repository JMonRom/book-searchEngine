  ## Description

  I started off by first looking through the code and understanding what is being started with. This was one of the most challenging homeworks to work through despite having starter code. I was having a lot of trouble at the beginning with what file to start with, but following the readme guides was useful. 
  
  Part of the challenge for this homework was refactoring the RESTful API to GraphQL API. A lot of the previous activities and mini projects were helpful in providing guidance with what direction to take the files in. Another issue I ran into was allowing the user to login and create their website because I kept getting back an error with the proxy server which wasn't allowing the connection to be made to sign in and save the user. Eventually I was able to fix it by correcting server middleware and allow the graphql path to connect to local host.
